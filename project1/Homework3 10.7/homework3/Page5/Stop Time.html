      <h3 style="color:#1A4A90";>“Amazing! Where is Stop Time,” Eunice jumped out of joy. 
“I don’t have an idea.”

      <h3 style="color:#1A4A90";>"How far is Stop Eternity?" Eunice asked. 
  "That's very far." He blew his coffee in a leisurely manner. </h3>
      
      <h3 style="color:#1A4A90";>“Is it far away from the place where the sun rises? Even the sea water is warm there. " 

  "Much farther.”

      <h3 style="color:#1A4A90";>“Is it far away from the deep seabed? There lies a beautiful mermaid palace. "

  "Much farther.”

      <h3 style="color:#1A4A90";>“Is it far farther away than the moon? There is Diana and her fawn. They play together. " 

  "Much farther."

      <h3 style="color:#1A4A90";>"Is it higher than the top of clouds?" It's the home of the rain. " 

  "Much farther."

      <h3 style="color:#1A4A90";>“Is it far away from childhood? I can never go back again. " 

  "Much farther."
