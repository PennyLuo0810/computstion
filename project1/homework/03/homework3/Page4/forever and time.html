      <h3 style="color:#9F8CC9";>People pursue the beauty that eternality brings and fear wither and death that time brings.</h3>
      

      <h3 style="color:#9F8CC9";>After so many years' preparation, an agreement between humans and their kings was finally established. They set up a coalition, planning to kill Atropos the god of time. </h3>

      <h3 style="color:#9F8CC9";>The only problem is Clotho were twins, they were difficult to distinguish. Finally, humans found their difference. Clotho was just one second older than Atropos. Then, Kings, with their detailed operational plan, led their soldiers to take pocket watches to distinguish Atropos and Clotho. </h3>

      <h3 style="color:#9F8CC9";>When Zeus left the temple at dusk the day after, humans launched an attack on the temple. In a very short time, armies killed the Spirit, burned the altar, rushed into the temple.</h3>

      <h3 style="color:#9F8CC9";>At the very second when the coalition approached Atropos, Zeus, the God of the world, arrived in time. In the presence of God, human beings were just like sand grains, and the attack of the coalition was crushed immediately. Since then, the god of eternal and the god of time disappeared in the world. </h3>
