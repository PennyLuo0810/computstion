  “Kid, you can't get anywhere called eternity." He drank the coffee at one bite.  With disappointment, Eunice decided to turn to others.
  "Excuse me, do you know where Stop Eternity is?" Eunice asked. 
  "Oh, there is only one kind of eternity, that is, there never exist eternity." The old witch said softly. 
  "Excuse me, do you know where Stop Eternity is?" Eunice asked.

      <h3 style="color:#F29C8C";>Eternity is that sleeping forever without a prince’s kiss. But it can be a miracle when you receive a Christmas gift that is just the one you are eager to own when you walked past a shop window. Believe me, there is no eternity in the world, and there is no eternal sense of security. Eternity only lies in the end of fairy tales, only belonging to princes and princesses in the castle. Everyone has eternity in his heart, but he or she will never know where Stop Eternity is.
