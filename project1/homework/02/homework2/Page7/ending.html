  When Eunice got off from the bus, heading home, the snow had already stopped. The bells of Christmas Eve began to ring. " Eunice, you come home! Come and help us prepare for the Christmas dinner. " "Mom, I went to a lot of places by bus today." "oh, really?" "I went to seek Stop Eternity, but no one knows where it is. I know now that it is impossible to own eternity, and it does not exist at all. "It does exist. There's eternity in this world!" "But where is it?" "Now, we are at the Stop Eternity. I love you forever!" Eternity will always be one more second faster than Time. How big the world is? The world becomes a little bigger as you go any farther.</h3>
